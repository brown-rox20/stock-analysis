# Stock Analysis Overview

<!-- the purpose and background are well defined -->

## Background

Steve originally wanted an analysis of selected stock's performance for the year 2017 and 2018 to show to his parents in order to help them pick the best stocks. He was very happy with the original results but wants to take the project a step further. Now he is asking for an analysis for all stocks that will run reliably when using several years worth of data.

## Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to go over the original code and refactor it to run faster in case larger datasets are used down the line. We will check the our work by using a input box for the year and an output box message to display the runtime.

# Results

<!-- the analysis is well described with screenshots and code -->

The original code's purpose was to look through two data tables(2017 and 2018) to find the volume and return for each ticker and display the results on a new tab within a data table. We added a few formatting commads as well in order to call out the most disired stocks at a glance.

Below is the message box that displays the runtime of our original code
